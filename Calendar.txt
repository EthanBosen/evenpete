HTML alone does not have built-in capabilities for importing or displaying calendar data directly. To display a calendar on an HTML page, you typically need to use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or utilize a pre-built calendar library.

Here are a few common approaches to adding a calendar to an HTML page:

Using JavaScript Libraries:

FullCalendar: FullCalendar is a popular JavaScript library that allows you to display interactive calendars on your web page. You can include it in your HTML document and use it to create and manage events.
Example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>/
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="fullcalendar.css">
    <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="moment.min.js"></script>
    <script src="fullcalendar.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
            var calendarEl = document.getElementById('calendar');
            var calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
                // Configuration options here
            });
            calendar.render();
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id='calendar'></div>
</body>
</html>
You would need to download and include the required CSS and JavaScript files for FullCalendar.

Google Calendar Integration:

You can embed a Google Calendar into your HTML page. Google provides an "Embed Code" option that you can customize and paste into your HTML document. This allows you to display a Google Calendar on your website.

Example:

html
Copy code
<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=yourcalendar%40domain.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
Custom Calendar Development:

If you want more control and flexibility, you can create your own custom calendar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach gives you the freedom to design and implement a calendar that suits your specific requirements.

Example:

html
Copy code
<!-- Create your own HTML and CSS for a custom calendar -->
<div class="custom-calendar">
    <!-- Calendar content goes here -->
</div>
Depending on your specific needs, you can choose the method that best suits your project, whether it's using a pre-built library like FullCalendar, embedding a Google Calendar, or creating a custom calendar from scratch.
